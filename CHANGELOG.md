# Changelog

## [1.1.5] - 2026-09-14

### Added
- Modals sync with the speaker view. Fixes [#8](https://github.com/martinomagnifico/reveal.js-multimodal/issues/8)
- HTML modals sync their scroll position with the speaker view (not iframes)

### Fixed
- The `overlaycolor` and `radius` options no longer fall back to the defaults after the first modal closes
- A `data-modal-overlaycolor` that matches the default colour now applies
- Classes from `data-modal-class` are removed after closing, also with `speed: 0`, and no other classes are
- Long HTML content was visible on the slide in the Markdown demo

### Changed
- Videos and autoplaying iframes are muted in the speaker view

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-22

### Changed
- This new version is a rewrite built with Vite
- Updated for the use of the latest version of Reveal.js.
- Uses pluginToolkit to check if it is running in a module environment and will then not autoload the CSS
- Fixed the `closebuttonhtml` option: the default close button was assigned right after the option was applied, so a custom button was never used

## [0.1.3] - 2024-04-16

### Changed
- Fix for 'bodyscrolllock'. Opening a locknav-link no longer breaks on iOS. However, when the lock is enabled on iOS, somehow scrolling back up is still possible. The functionality may be removed (for iOS) in the future.
